<h3><strong>Biography</h3>
<p> Hello! My name is Amy Ho. I'm seventeen years old and I currently attend Castro Valley High School.
  I was born on May 1st, 2000, in Oakland, California and my ethnicity is Chinese-American.
  Some hobbies I enjoy are playing badminton, shopping, surfing the internet, and reading books.
  My favorite color is lavender and I really like dogs, particularly corgis, pugs, and samoyeds.
  I am an avid Yelper. Here's the link to my Yelp account: https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ki9SBaaCuzut3falnOkK6A </p>
