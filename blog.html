<p> My idea of robots changed. I didn't know that the definition of robots was so simple. Before, I thought robots were just the typical,
stereotypical ones like the ones in Wall-E and the Robots movie. In the future, robots would be extremely helpful to those with disabilities.
I'm nervous about the possibility that robots will eventually take over the human world and make the human race useless and lazy. </p>
<p2> When we were stuck on a problem, we were able to solve them as a group. I thought that we worked out everything well and in an
  efficient manner. </p2>
<p3> They both have to do with human interaction.
<p4> We worked well together on the lightshow. We helped each other and we explained what we were doing to each other. 
<p5> The pins have to be at the correct slots and the wires have to follow the other wire's endpoint.
